# Agent-based modeling in Python
@author: Jackie Kazil

## What is agent based modeling
- Complexity
- game theory
- computer simulation, agencies have their own rules
- components: space, agents, time, visualization
- agent: entities making decisions
- simplified ABM example: Conway's game of life, cells live or die based on cells around them
- Schelling segregation model (1971)
- predator-prey dynamics, sheep/wolves model at northwestern
- GeoSim, modeling cities and displacement

## ABM use cases
- flows: traffic, evacuation
- markets: stock exchange, shopbots
- organizations: operational risk, org design
- diffusion innovation and adoption dynamics
- shows the path to solutions, explicitly incorporate spatial / network attributes
- giving agents memory
- agent interactions are heterogeneous
- network effects, actions differ from expected behavior based on what' around them

#### Video: kilobots, swarm robots at MIT
- emergence, order from chaos
- simulation of natural processes based on neighbors

## ABM tools
- 89 tools
- https://bit.ly/wiki-abms
- mostly java based
    - netlogo
    - MASON (java)
    - Repast (java)
- python based: simx, pycx, pyabm, Mesa
