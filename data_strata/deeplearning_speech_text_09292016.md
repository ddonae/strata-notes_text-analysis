# Advances in deep learning for text and speech

What is deep learning?
- Replacing hand crafted features with low level features (i.e. pixels)
- began with the artificial neuron (perceptron)

History of deep learning
- began in 2006
- 2011: breakthrough in speech recognition
- 2015: recurrent neural networks (RNN)
- 2016: AlphaGo

Deep learning glossary:
- DNN: Deep Neural Network, supervised classifier
- Deep auto encoder: unsupervised feature learning
- RNN: hidden layers to input layers
- LSTM: long short term memory
- GRU: gated recurrent units

Machine perception vs cognition
- perception: interpretive like a human, seeing, hearing, machine touch
- cognition: reasoning, decision, expertise, natural language processing (NLP)

evolution of deep learning
- before 2011: rule based, machine learning
- 2011 - 2014: neural networks, performance similar to humans, lead by big companies like Google and Microsoft
- 2015 to present: advanced modeling, performance sometimes better than humans

Deep learning in Speech
- speech recognition
    - signal = features
    - acoustic = sounds
    - language = words
- speech analytics
    - metadata
    - feature extraction, speech representation, classification algorithm
- speech synthesis
    - WaveNet by DeepMind

Deep learning in Text
- using RNN & LSTM to improve features
- word embedding : creating vectors to quantify abstract relationships between words
    - Example: King + Woman - Man = Queen
- sequence to sequence: encode and decode with LSTM
- sentiment analysis deep learning style: CNN-LSTM, word embedding plus logistic regression
- part of speech tagging (POS)
- machine translation: Google NMT
- automatic text summarization: Chopra
- image captioning: Google Show and Tell

Bots
- using sequence to sequence
- LSTM to encode and decode plus RNN to get answer from question
- Google email reply

What's next?
- speech
    - noisy speech: far and distant
    - language expansion (other languages besides English)
    - better models
    - big data and unsupervised methods
- text
    - machine comprehension
    - NLP for conversations
    - automatic knowledge base
- artificial intelligence
    - multimodal data fusion: text, speech, vision
    - conversational AI, machines conversing with humans
    - personal assistant
