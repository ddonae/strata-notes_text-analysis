# Holographic visualization: world of immersive visualization
@author: Brad Sarsfield, Microsoft Hololense

holograms, defined: light tricks to think its in front of you

world of mixed reality

Challenges of holograms: indoor vs outdoor experience of lighting, battery and wireless, arm fatigue

3D visualization has historically been problematic, not a good way to accurately capture information in an intuitive way
now have a new perspective, motion parallex, using cues to see depth
removed force perspective works around occulusion, gives less control

With immersive visuals, people like
- to walk around it
- place it on a flat surface
- have gravity
- vertically orient it
- it must be aware of where you are and adjust itself

people think of immersive visualization a real objects, they don't want an unnatural experience
applying physics to make it realistic and believable

New trend: using "handles" to move and manipulate, allows users to grab, scalle, and rotate

Use cases
- NASA jet propulsion lab, MARS rover
- Lowes kitchen design
- Case Westerm study of anatomy
- tumors in patients for surgeons
- Trimble: building architecture
- 8 ninths trading platform
- virtual cove, data tubes for stocks

Encode higher dimensions of data, able to unveil confounding factors through layers and interaction
creates a better experience of understanding data

Example: elevator technician, uses immersive visualization for training, job prep, consolidating information, increasing productivity
saves time and effort
integrates data
pull out what you need, when you need it, on demand
trigger call to experts
reduce stress

cretes more opportunities for collaboration
easy access to experts, anywhere
sharing points of view and perspective
sharing data
remote team collaboration

using humanoid avatars in remote teams
provides gaze vector to show where person is looking
using color and accessories to give personality

interaction problems
- focus: hard to know where to look
- selection: what can I ask on?
- input: gaze, gesture, voices -- doing this all at once is overwhelming and hard
- navigation: transition, where and how
- where does the content go?
- manipulation

Example: hot air balloon immersion
- can't jump from ground and make people fly up to balloon, it makes people nauseous
- must fade to black and then reappear
