# DJ Patil, White House Chief Data Scientist, Ask me anything

So how can we, as technologists, help?
- at the federal level: whitehouse.gov/usds, 18F, USAjobs
- local: code for america, police department ride alongs
- you first have to sit with them and understand the problem
- hackathons
- volunteering: teaching code
- technology relationship brokers
- example agencies: CFPB, FDA, etc.

Data access in government
- ask them what is important
- how to make it useful
- open data mandate

How do we make data accessible to local governments?  
They don't have data scientists, can we make it more self service?
- starting with technology stack improvements
- help them understanding why they need to collect data and what does it look like
- you have to understand their journey / day in the life
    - what part can you free up?

what is the state of architecture at the local level?
- what architecture?
- passing around spreadsheets as data sharing
- show them modern architecture, art of the possible
- Examples: smart city intiative, Big Data Hub (regional East and West)

How can we improve the state of health data to enter the genomic era?
- electronic health records
- improving data access and sharing, patients still can't get access to their, especially moving from state to state
- HIPAA guidance from the HHS civil rights organization
- upcoming: Common rule and consent
- show them the value proposition of open , data -- open data is more usable!
- health 2.0 talk
- make it an "and" conversation (instead of "or"), "we can do this and this"
- federal source code policy

What does continuity look like for White House?
- aggressive transition planning for the first 100 days
- we aren't done yet, it's 4th quarter time
- CS for all in K-12
- ethics and security for all data science programs

Data science and national security
- private and public partnerships
- before Ash Carter, DOD hadn't been to silicon valley in 20 years
- have to align dialogue and expectations
- continue to promote the revolving door, bringing commercial adavances to federal and vice versa

What's the White House vision for machine readble data?
- data.gov
- making data available as flat file and API
- Big Data and Civil Rights: how data is being is stored and what happens when an algorithm acts upon it?
- agile refactoring process in aggregating data, making sure data is captured and updated
- White house precision medicine, security principles from NIST

How should we handle data scientists from foreign countries, who are often barred from helping due to visa limitations?
- this is all tied up in immigration policy
- can get aroudn this by working for contractors
- white house startup visa policy
